# Always Confirm Before Implementing

**CRITICAL**: Before making any code changes or implementations:

1. **ALWAYS ask for confirmation** before changing code,
   unless the user's prompt/question clearly indicates they want implementation
2. When user asks "how to do ...", "what is...", "is it possible...":
   provide information/explanation first, then ask if they want implementation
3. User's prompt/question clearly indicates they want implementation usually has
   some words like "implement", "fix", "add", "change", "do it", ...
   but not limited to these words.
