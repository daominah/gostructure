# Markdown Writing Style

I prefer the Markdown can be read without rendering too,
my editor usually can show a line with 80 characters (max 100 characters)
so try to break the line (in raw Markdown, does matter in rendered Markdown)
at around 80 characters.
Breaking line when a sentence ends or a comma that end a part of meaning
is better than just break by character count.

Table can be an exception, don't need to add line break for raw Markdown.

This markdown file is also a good example of how to write markdown in this style.
The previous lines can be written in a single line,
but I break them into multiple lines to make it easier to read and edit without rendering.
